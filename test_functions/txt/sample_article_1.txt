Last year, TD reported US$285 million in net income in its first quarter
from its investment in Schwab. TD says adjusted net income should work
out to about US$230 million, for about a 30 per cent drop from last
year’s US$328 million. Canaccord Genuity Group Inc. analyst Matthew Lee
says the Schwab results came in slightly higher than expected, but that
the financial firm’s outlook for the year disappointed. Lee said key
takeaways for the year from U.S. bank earnings in recent days are net
income pressure, improved capital markets and continued credit
challenges on commercial real estate loans, some of which translate into
Canadian trends as well. “In terms of cross-border read-throughs, we
expect the Canadian banks to see similar trends in capital markets and
loan growth but do not necessarily expect to see the same level of net
interest margin pressure as mortgage renewals help to offset increasing
deposit costs.” Lee said Bank of Montreal and Royal Bank of Commerce
should benefit the most from improvements in U.S. capital markets, while
TD will be most affected by softer net interest income in the country.
